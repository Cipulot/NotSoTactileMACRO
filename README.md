This final prototype of the NotSoTactileMACRO. In this configuration there are 12 MX switches + 1 button from the rotary encoder on the bottom. The button for the encoder in the middle is used for resetting the Arduino Micro board.

## Design

As for the majority of this kind of projects a matrix is implemented for the switches. In particular, to reduce component usage, the internal pull up system has being used for the pins.

Here's a picture of the schematic for the board:
